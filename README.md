# VSMaterialTheme
A theme for Visual Studio 2015 based off of Material Design themes. (In progress)

## Preview of theme:
Here's a small preview of this theme with some random example C++ code.

There's still a lot to do and some (or many) colors will be changed. Who knew that creating a theme for Visual Studio would take so much work? :)

## Contribute
If you would like to contribute in some way, I would greatly appreciate it. Seriously, there's a lot of little details and things I've never heard of before. If you see any areas that you use that are still black or just the wrong color (I started with the Dark theme), please notify me with an issue.

The color palette that I'm using is from the [Material Design style guide](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette). I'm also using [Visual Studio 2015 Color Theme Editor](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6f4b51b6-5c6b-4a81-9cb5-f2daa560430b) to create the theme.
